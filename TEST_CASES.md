### Implemented Test Cases in `DemoApplicationTests.java`

*   **Test Case ID:** OC_001
*   **Description:** Verify that the controller can retrieve offers for a valid address.
*   **Component/Module:** OfferController - Offer Retrieval Endpoint - Uses realistic dummy offer data based on API responses.
*   **Scenario:** A request is made with a valid address.
*   **Expected Behavior:** The controller should return a list of offers provided by the external APIs for the given address. This list may be empty if no offers is available.
*   **Test Code Reference (Optional):**

*   **Test Case ID:** OC_002
*   **Description:** Verify that the controller returns a bad request error for missing address parameters.
*   **Component/Module:** OfferController - Offer Retrieval Endpoint
*   **Scenario:** A request is made with one or more missing address parameters (e.g., street, houseNumber, city, or plz).
*   **Expected Behavior:** The controller should return an HTTP status of 400 Bad Request.
*   **Test Code Reference (Optional):** `testGetAllOffersWithMissingAddressParams` in `DemoApplicationTests.java`

*   **Test Case ID:** OC_003
*   **Description:** Verify that the controller returns an empty response when no offers are found by any service.
*   **Component/Module:** OfferController - Offer Retrieval Endpoint
*   **Scenario:** A request is made with a valid address, but all external services return an empty list of offers.

### Test Cases to be Implemented/Considered

*   **Comprehensive Performance Testing:** Requires specialized tools like JMeter or Gatling to simulate load and measure performance metrics under various conditions.
*   **Testing with Different Combinations of External Service Responses:** Requires a mocking framework (e.g., Mockito) to control the behavior of external service dependencies and simulate scenarios where some services return offers while others return errors or empty lists.
*   **Testing Edge Cases for Offer Data:** Requires a mocking framework to control the data returned by external services and test scenarios with missing or invalid fields, zero prices, or unusually large/small values.
*   **Error Handling for Specific External Service Errors:** Requires a mocking framework to simulate specific error types from external services and verify appropriate handling and error reporting by the controller.
*   **Testing with Different Data Volumes:** Comprehensive testing requires specialized tools for load simulation to evaluate the controller's behavior and performance with varying volumes of data.
*   **Filtering and Sorting:** Not applicable at this time as this functionality is not currently implemented in the `OfferController`.
